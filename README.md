# minimal_autonomous_rover_route
a simple demo routine to begin with, for your automomous rover. This example
project has been written for the MSP430G2 launchpad of Texas Instruments.


With this project you can get an idea on how to create a predifined route
for your autonomous rover. You can also get an idea on how to avoid obstacles
and continue your route. You will need a motor driver, which will receive the
input signals from the MSP430 and translate them to motion.
